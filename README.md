# Vision Processor
A replacement for the aging (ssl-vision)[https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-vision].
The shape based blob detector and decentralized software architecture is intended to
minimize setup time and improve detection rates in uneven illumination conditions.
It currently supports Teledyne FLIR (Spinnaker), Matrix Vision (Bluefox3/mvIMPACT) and OpenCV camera backends.

The `vision_processor` is the image processing component that processes a camera feed
to multicast the detected robot and ball positions and a debug video livestream.
The geometry publisher `geom_publisher.py` publishes the field geometry
for all vision_processors, teams and the game controller.
`cam_viewer.py` opens the `mpv` video player with the camera streams from the vision_processor instances.

## Wrapper

A modular replacement for `geom_publisher.py` plus a browser UI:

- `wrapper_backend/` — async Python (uv-managed). Owns the field geometry, absorbs incoming calibrations, exposes the bus over WebSocket. Run with `./start_wrapper.sh` (defaults to `geometry-divB.yml`). See [`wrapper_backend/README.md`](wrapper_backend/README.md).
- `gui/frontend/` — Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite. Connects to the backend's WebSocket and renders the operator UI. Run with `cd gui/frontend && npm install && npm run dev`. See [`gui/frontend/README.md`](gui/frontend/README.md).

## Dependency installation and compilation

### Only geom_publisher.py cam_viewer.py (e.g. vision expert laptop)
Required only for the geometry publisher and camera viewer.
`mpv` is optional and only required for the camera viewer.

Debian/Ubuntu based distributions: `apt install protobuf-compiler python3-protobuf python3-yaml mpv`

Arch based distributions: `pacman -S make python-protobuf python-yaml mpv`

Installation with PIP: `pip install protobuf pyyaml`

### vision_processor automatic (recommended)

1. Install the camera SDK required for your camera type
   (Arch user repository mvIMPACT: `mvimpact-acquire` Spinnaker: `spinnaker-sdk`)
2. Debian/Ubuntu/Arch Linux/Manjaro: Run `./setup.sh`.
   If the script wants to install an OpenCL driver for the wrong GPU (e.g. integrated graphics card)
   or you want, need or have a different OpenCL driver skip the driver installation with `SKIP_DRIVERS=1 ./setup.sh`.


### vision_processor manual

1. Install the camera SDK required for your camera type
   (Arch user repository mvIMPACT: `mvimpact-acquire` Spinnaker: `spinnaker-sdk`)
2. Install the required dependencies:

   - cmake
   - Eigen3
   - ffmpeg
   - gcc
   - OpenCL (GPU based runtime recommended)
   - OpenCV
   - protobuf
   - yaml-cpp

3. Compile vision_processor:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cmake -B build .
    make -C build vision_processor


## Setup

1. Complete the dependency installation and compilation section.
2. Configure one `config-minimal.yml` or `config.yml` for each camera, skip the `geometry` section for now.
   The camera ids are assigned like in ssl-vision:
   ![Camera id pattern](camera_ids.png)
3. Start `build/vision_processor config[X].yml` for each camera.
4. Tune the orientation and position of each camera.
   You can view the camera feeds with `python/cam_viewer.py --cameras <X>`.
5. Restart the `vision_processor`s for the generation of a new sample image `img/[X].raw.jpg`
   and complete the `geometry` section of each camera config with it.
   Visual explanation how to determine `line_corners`: ![Line corner example](line_corners.png)
6. Restart all `vision_processor`s to pick up the new `geometry` section.
   Subsequent edits to thresholds, tracking limits and color references in `config[X].yml`
   are picked up live (within ~0.5 s) without a restart; camera, geometry, network and stream
   sections still require a restart.
7. Modify `geometry[X].yml` to match your field geometry.
   (for simple use cases configuring the field size, penalty area and goal will suffice)
8. Start `python/geom_publisher.py geometry[X].yml`.
   The calibration is successful when the reprojected livestream views are parallel to the image frame.
   If the calibration is unsuccessful, restart the geom_publisher for a new geometry calibration.
   For setups with multiple cameras it is recommended to tune the calibration by hand.


## Troubleshooting

Further information regarding setup and troubleshooting can be found in [documentation.md](documentation.md).

The camera livestream cycles through 4 different views:
1. **Raw camera data**
   If the data is very bright, dark or miscolored consider adjusting
   the camera `gain`, `exposure` and `white_balance` in your `config[X].yml`.
2. **Reprojected color delta**
   If the visible reprojected image extent does not match the field boundary the geometry calibration has issues.
   If color blobs are desaturated in the center your image might be overexposed/too bright (`gain`, `exposure`).
3. **Gradient dot product**
   All color blobs should be visible here as black and white checkered rings.
4. **Blob circularity score**
   If the blob score of some undetected blobs is too faint consider reducing the `circularity` threshold.

### No OpenCL platform/device found

If no OpenCL platform can be found despite OpenCL driver installation, check the users groups and permission to compute
on the GPU (e.g. for Intel: ![necessary user groups](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/installation-guide-hpc-cluster/2023-0/step-4-set-up-user-permissions-for-using-the.html#SET-PERMISSIONS)).

### Bots frequently changing team and IDs

If the blobs are nearly white: adjust exposure, gain and gamma such that the blobs are no longer oversaturated.

### Ghost balls at field line crossings

- Adjust the white balance such that field lines have no orange tint.
- Carefully try increasing the `score` threshold.

### Balls undetected or blobs are attributed the wrong color

If blobs are attributed the wrong color (or balls are seemingly undetected despite high blob scores)
adjust the reference colors under `color`.

### Bot detections are lost in close distance

If bot detections are lost when multiple bots are in close distance (e.g. during collisions), increase `clipping_tolerance`.

### Calibration is wrong on a field missing some standard lines

If your physical field is missing one of the optional SSL markings (center-to-center line, halfway line, center circle, or penalty-area stretches), the calibration is fed lines that the camera cannot see and the reprojection does not match the field boundary.
In `geometry[X].yml` set the corresponding flag under `optional_field_lines` to `false`:

    optional_field_lines:
      goal2goal: false     # set to false if your field has no end-to-end center line
      halfway: true
      centercircle: true
      penalty: true

### Bottom half of frames looks smeared / blurred (H.264 network source)

H.264 RTSP streams can silently produce corrupted frames on slower or throttled machines. Switch the source to MJPEG, or run on a machine with a real OpenCL GPU.

### If nothing else helps

Activate `stream: raw_feed: true` in your `config[X].yml` and record the video livestream
with `ffmpeg -protocol_whitelist file,rtp,udp -i python/cam[X].sdp cam[X].mp4`.
Publish the resulting video including your `config[X].yml` and `geometry[X].yml` for further remote analysis in a bug report.
